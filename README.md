# Project 6 - *BeReal Pt. 2*

Submitted by: **Kennedy Parks**

**BeReal Pt.2** is an app that allows users to upload images from their camera onto a feed that can be viewed by other users. In this update, users can only view images uploaded by other users in the past 24 hours by uploading their own images. Before uploading an image, the user can only see blurred out images in their feed.

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ ] User can launch camera to take photo instead of photo library
  - I couldn't use my phone's camera, so this feature was not added. Users can upload from their photo library
- [x] User session persists when application is closed and relaunched
- [x] Users are able to log out and return to sign in page
- [x] Users are NOT able to see other photos until they upload their own	
 
The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User receive notifcation when it is time to post
- [ ] Users can make comments and view comments in posts	

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
 - Allowing the users to use their cameras to upload photos would be great ðŸ˜­
